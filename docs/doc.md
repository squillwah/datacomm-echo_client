# Technical Manual: Data Comm Echo Client

## Overview

The data comm echo client is a  Python-based network communication application designed to connect to a TCP server and exchange messages using the socket library. This program demonstrates fundamental clientâ€“server communication principles where the client sends messages and the server echoes them back.

### Source files

- ```client.py```
  - Defines the client data and functionality
- ```commands.py```
  - Defines commands to interact with the client
- ```messages.py```
  - Defines a message and procedures to work with them
- ```run.py```
  - Basic script which creates a client and starts a command input loop
- ```sock.py```
  - Defines a class to manage socket connections

## Installation

To run our client, download **all five** of the python files and place them in the **same directory**. Afterwards, use python to execute the **``run.py``** script in your terminal.

### Requirements

- **Python 3.13.7+**
  - Our client was written and tested on **Python 3.13.7**. Other versions may work, but some *(below 3.10)* definitely won't.
- **Socket, Enum, & Dataclass Python Libraries**
  - These should come bundled with your installation of python.
- **A TCP Echo Server**
  - Our client works best with a server mimicking the functionality of the echo server running on draco1. Establishing connections to other servers over TCP is possible, but subject to hangs if they behave unexpectedly.

## How to use

- **Commands**
  - Our client supports many commands. To start, try 'help' or 'help all'.
- **Modifiers**
  - Messages can be modified with three modifiers: **noecho**, **caps**, and **reverse**.
  - To add a modifier to your message, prefix its text with **;mod**. 

### Quick start commands

**simple**  
If you just want to verify that the project requirements have been met, simply use the 'simple' command. All messages typed while simple is active will instantly be sent to the connected server and read back automatically. To exit the simple command, type 'complex'.

**write**   
Alternatively, you can use the 'write' command write one message at a time. By default, the *instantsend* and *instantread* flags are set, so writing a message with 'write' is functionally the same as writing a message in 'simple'. 

**quit**  
To quit the client, simply type 'quit'. This will nicely close your connection to the server and shut down the client process.
